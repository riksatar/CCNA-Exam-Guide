# CCNA – Study Guide & Exam Tips

I recently cleared the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) exam and wanted to share my preparation journey. The CCNA focuses on networking fundamentals, IP connectivity, security basics, and automation. It is not about memorizing commands, but about understanding how networks operate, how to configure devices, and how to troubleshoot effectively.

The exam is a mix of multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, and simulation/lab-style questions where you must configure or troubleshoot Cisco devices.

## Preparation Timeline (4–5 weeks)

1. **Week 1**: Watched video lectures (CBT Nuggets, Jeremy’s IT Lab on YouTube) to cover core concepts.  
2. **Week 2–3**: Hands-on practice using Packet Tracer, GNS3, or Cisco Modeling Labs for routing, switching, and troubleshooting.  
3. **Week 4–5**: Practice exams (Skillcertpro). It was the only one I used, it has good amount questions that are enough. About 70–80% of the actual exam questions came from these sets.Thats how close they are. Highly recommended.

## Preparation Tips

- Focus on networking fundamentals instead of just memorizing CLI commands.  
- Set up a lab using Packet Tracer or GNS3 for hands-on practice.  
- Use practice tests to understand exam-style scenario questions.  
- Pay attention to subnetting and IP addressing — these appear frequently.  
- Review Cisco’s official exam blueprint to ensure all topics are covered.

## High-Priority Topics on the Exam

1. **Network Fundamentals**  
   - OSI and TCP/IP models  
   - IPv4 vs IPv6 addressing and subnetting  
   - ARP, DNS, DHCP basics  
   - Cable types and standards (Ethernet, fiber)  

2. **Network Access**  
   - VLANs, trunking (802.1Q), inter-VLAN routing  
   - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) basics  
   - Port security, switch configuration  

3. **IP Connectivity**  
   - Static and dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP basics)  
   - Default gateway configuration  
   - Routing table interpretation  

4. **IP Services**  
   - NAT, PAT  
   - NTP, DHCP configuration  
   - DNS concepts  

5. **Security Fundamentals**  
   - ACLs (standard vs extended)  
   - Device hardening (passwords, SSH, AAA basics)  
   - VPN concepts  

6. **Automation and Programmability**  
   - REST APIs, JSON  
   - Basics of Cisco DNA, controllers, SDN concepts  
   - Network automation fundamentals (Python/Ansible awareness)

## Exam-Day Strategy

- 100–120 questions, 120 minutes.  
- Questions include multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, and simulations.  
- Time management is important — don’t spend too long on lab simulations.  
- Read carefully: some questions are tricky with similar answer choices.  
- Mark difficult questions for review and move on quickly.

## Resources That Helped

- Skillcertpro CCNA Practice Tests  
- Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3 for labs  
- Jeremy’s IT Lab CCNA YouTube series (free)  
- CBT Nuggets CCNA course  
- Boson ExSim practice exams (very close to real exam feel)  
- Cisco Official Cert Guide

## Exam-Day Experience

The exam had a good mix of theory and hands-on labs. Subnetting, VLANs, ACLs, and OSPF appeared multiple times. A few questions required configuring routers and switches in a simulated environment. Many questions looked simple but required careful reading to avoid traps. Time was enough — I finished with about 10 minutes to spare.

## Final Tip

CCNA is not about memorizing commands, but about truly understanding how networking works. Build a lab, practice real configurations, and reinforce concepts with mock exams. If you can subnet quickly, configure VLANs, and troubleshoot routing issues in a lab, you will pass the CCNA confidently.
